            I'm currently a PhD student in Medical Physics at Dalhousie University. My academic journey has included earning a Master of Science in Physics from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Science in both Physics and Computer Science from St. Francis Xavier University. My research interests involve using machine learning and Monte carlo simulations

During my Master's at the University of Toronto, I worked on the SuperCDMS experiment, where I used machine learning to determine the location of particle interactions within the detector. This work helps to filter out background events that can mimic the dark matter interactions we're looking for. By training models on simulated data, I was able to predict event positions, which then allows for the exclusion of events at the detector edges. I also used a custom genetic optimization algorithm to improve the model's accuracy and interpretability.

For a previous project, I explored charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) as a potential sign of new physics. Using the BaBar analysis framework and ROOT macros, I analyzed data to detect CLFV events. I applied machine learning to simulated data and was able to achieve a success rate of over 99% for detecting these events. When I adjusted the model to have perfect sensitivity, it still maintained a notable 89% accuracy.

I am also the first author on a paper that is currently in review titled "Machine Learning in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence and Risk Prediction: the Value of Feature Selection," which is currently under review. This study used a patient dataset to develop and validate machine learning models for predicting thyroid cancer recurrence. Our models achieved a prediction accuracy of 94.8% to 95.9%. The study also looked at predicting American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk scores, which could help with personalized healthcare.

Additionally, for I worked on a study that uses a time-reversed approach, where we simulate muons' movement upward through the atmosphere starting from sea-level measurements. Our Monte Carlo simulation, developed in C++, offers a more efficient way to understand muon dynamics compared to traditional methods.
