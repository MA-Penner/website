            I've completed an Honors degree in Physics along with a degree in Computer Science at St. Francis Xavier University. My physics research was centred on high-energy physics, specifically cosmic rays, while my computer science studies focused on machine learning. I'm currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Physics at the University of Toronto, where I'm working on  SuperCDMS.
            For my second project, I studied charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV), a sign of new physics beyond the standard model. The project familiarized me with experimental setup and data analysis. I was introduced to the BaBar analysis framework and was given several Ntuple files, which I analyzed to determine the invariant mass in the upsilon (2s) decay (to electron and muon). I implemented several selection cuts gradually.

I then attacked this problem from a different angle using machine learning. I wrote a ROOT macro to convert data in a ROOT tree into a CSV format. I used simulation data for the events to allow for events with CLFV, then took out any features that are specific to simulations and that would be unknown in real experiments, reducing the feature space to 101 features. I implemented K-Fold validation with KNN's, SVM's, an ANN, and a random forest to evaluate their performance. After focusing on accuracy and achieving 99.3% accuracy with a random forest, a particular focus was given to enhancing the sensitivity of the models because CLFV is such a rare event you cannot afford to miss it even once. I made adjustments, including biasing the KNN's and random forest towards positive predictions, to ensure no potential CLFV event was overlooked. My results indicate that the random forest algorithm, when adjusted for high sensitivity, outperformed other models, with perfect sensitivity while still maintaining 89% accuracy for the data set (made of 10,000 events with CLFV and 10,000 without). This suggests its suitability for practical applications where reducing the workload of physicists without compromising the detection of rare events is crucial.

My third project, “Investigating Cosmic Muon Behavior Using Monte Carlo Simulations” (currently being prepared for publication) is based on my summer research with Dr. Ahmed. This study utilizes a unique time-reversed approach. The research starts from known measurements at sea level and works backward in time, simulating muon behavior as we ascend through the Earth’s atmosphere. This method stands in contrast to conventional methods, which typically begin at muon production high in the atmosphere and proceed downwards. The central tool in this investigation is a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation captures the reversed path of muons upwards through the Earth’s atmosphere, considering factors such as muon energy, height, angle of entry, and the effects of energy loss. This approach offers a novel perspective on cosmic muon decay.
