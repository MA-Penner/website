        <p>
            this project is the topic I hope to publish soon.
            for now here is the Abstract!

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This study delves into the intricate dynamics of muons, subatomic particles born from cosmic ray interactions with the Earth's atmosphere. Utilizing a unique, time-reversed approach, the research starts from known measurements at sea level and works backwards, simulating muon behaviour as we ascend through the Earth's atmosphere. This methodology stands in contrast to conventional methods, which typically begin at muon production high in the atmosphere and proceed downwards. The central tool in this investigation is a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation, developed in C++. This simulation captures the path of muons upwards through the Earth's atmosphere, considering factors such as muon energy, height, angle of entry, and the effects of energy loss and height change at each step. Results are visualized via plots. This reversed approach offers a robust computational tool and a novel perspective, using established data points to enhance our understanding of muon interaction with Earth's atmosphere. Ultimately, this study contributes to the broader knowledge base of particle physics and cosmic ray phenomena. </p>
